You also need version `v1.222.0` or later of [wasm-tools].\n\nTo install MoonBit, follow the instructions here (it is super-easy with VSCode):\nhttps://www.moonbitlang.com/download/\n\nThen, to build this SDK, clone the repo, and type:\n\n```bash\nmoon update && moon install\nmoon build\n```\n\n[Spin CLI tool]: https://developer.fermyon.com/spin\n[wasm-tools]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools\n\n## Run\n\nExamples can be found at: https://github.com/gmlewis/spin-moonbit-sdk-examples\n\nTo run an example, type:\n\n```bash\n$ cd hello-world\n$ spin up --build\n```\n\nthen from another terminal, hit the endpoint with `curl`:\n\n```bash\n$ curl -i localhost:3000/hello\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\ncontent-type: text/plain\ntransfer-encoding: chunked\ndate: Sat, 17 Aug 2024 00:15:14 GMT\n\nHello, World!\n```\n\nEach example contains a README. Please refer to the README for additional commands and setup instructions. It might also be required to issue an update command: `moon update` to retrieve the latest dependencies. \n\n## Status\n\nThe code has been updated to support compiler:\n\n```bash\n$ moon version --all\nmoon 0.1.20250407 (24afaca 2025-04-07) ~/.moon/bin/moon\nmoonc v0.1.20250410+15d580434 ~/.moon/bin/moonc\nmoonrun 0.1.20250407 (24afaca 2025-04-07) ~/.moon/bin/moonrun\n```\n",
