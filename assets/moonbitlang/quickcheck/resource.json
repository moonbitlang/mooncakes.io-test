The core is to automatically generate tests based on a the signature of the **specification / theorem** (i.e. properties which functions should satisfy) and QuickCheck then tests that the properties hold. The idea spread to other languages and is now implemented in **MoonBit**. Because of the differences in type systems between Haskell and MoonBit, the original idea morphed into something different. There are several differences to this approach:\n\n- We have discarded many ideas in Haskell QuickCheck that have been proven inappropriate by time.\n- Some features requires a very fancy type system were removed (Or not considered currently). For instance, the generation of functions requires GADT but MoonBit does not.\n- MoonBit QuickCheck brings many modern academic ideas into industrial practice (listed [below](#references)).\n\n## Beginner's Example\n\n### First Look\n\nLet's start with something very simple. Suppose that we just wrote a function `reverse` which takes an array as argument and returns its reverse. We want to test its functionality by writing unit tests:\n```moonbit\ntest \"reverse\" {\n  inspect!(reverse(([] : Array[Int])), content=\"[]\")\n  inspect!(reverse([1, 2, 3]), content=\"[3, 2, 1]\")\n}\n```\n\nIs this enough to prove that this function is correct? No, the bugs may lies in the remaining untested code. But if we want more rigorous verification, we may need to write more test cases. For the complicated program, there would never be time to. How can we reduce the cost of testing? The key to doing so must be to generalize the test functions, so that each function covers not only one test case, but many. This is where QuickCheck comes in. We can write a property that `reverse` should hold for any array, and QuickCheck will generate a large number of random array and check that the property holds for all of them.\n\nBut what property should we write? We may notice that the reverse of the reverse of an array is the original array. So we can write a property that `reverse` should hold for any array:\n```moonbit\nfn prop_reverse_identity(arr : Array[Int]) {\n  reverse(reverse(arr)) == arr\n}\n```\n\nWe may consider the code logically as:\n\n$$\n\\forall x: \\text{Array[T]}.\\space \\text{reverse}(\\text{reverse}(x)) = x\n$$\n\nLooks good, now we can use QuickCheck to test this property (Note that we wrap the function in `Arrow` to make it a `Testable` though implicit conversion not work now):\n```moonbit\ntest {\n  quick_check_fn!(prop_reverse_identity)\n  // equivalent to quick_check!(Arrow(prop_reverse_identity))\n}\n```\n\nThe `quick_check` function takes a `Testable` and runs tests, reporting the result (The three number in the brackets are the number of passed, discarded and total tests):\n```\n+++ [100/0/100] Ok, passed!\n```\n\n### Failure Diagnosis\n\nNow let's see another example: suppose we wrote a function `remove(arr : Array[Int], x : Int) -> Array[Int]` that takes an array and an element and returns a new array with **all** occurrences of `x` removed. The intuitive implementation is to search for `x` in the array and remove it if found:\n\n```moonbit\nfn remove(arr : Array[Int], x : Int) -> Array[Int] {\n  match arr.search(x) {\n    Some(i) => arr.remove(i) |> ignore\n    None => ()\n  }\n  arr\n}\n```\n\nWe may consider the following properties:\n- If an element was removed from the array, the length of the array should be less than or equal to the original array\n\n$$\n\\forall x:\\text{T}, a:\\text{Array[T]} . \\space\n\\text{length}(\\text{remove}(a,x)) \\leq \\text{length}(a)\n$$\n\n- If an element was removed from the array, the element should not exist in the array\n\n$$\n\\forall x:\\text{T}, a:\\text{Array[T]} . \\space\nx\\not\\in\\text{remove}(a,x)\n$$\n\nNow we translate the first property into MoonBit code (Note that the property function should have **only one** argument, but we can use tuple to pass multiple arguments):\n```moonbit\nfn prop_length_is_not_greater(iarr : (Int, Array[Int])) -> Bool {\n  let (x, arr) = iarr\n  let len = arr.length()\n  remove(arr, x).length() <= len\n}\n```\n\nRun QuickCheck, all tests passed. However, this property is not considered a good property because it is can be fulfilled easily and the test is not very meaningful. Most Bugs may still exist in the function.\n```\ntest {\n  quick_check_fn!(prop_length_is_not_greater)\n}\n\n// +++ [100/0/100] Ok, passed!\n```\n\nThe later property is considered better (The `with_max_success` function sets the number of tests that should be performed to `1000`):\n```moonbit\nfn prop_remove_not_presence(iarr : (Int, Array[Int])) -> Bool {\n  let (x, arr) = iarr\n  remove(arr, x).contains(x).not()\n}\n\ntest {\n  quick_check_fn!(prop_remove_not_presence) |> with_max_success(1000)\n}\n```\n\nThe QuickCheck reports a failure with a counterexample in the second line after almost 100 tests:\n```\n*** [107/0/1000] Failed! Falsified.\n(0, [0, 0])\n```\n\nWhen `x = 0` and `arr = [0, 0]` the property does not hold. The `remove` function should remove all occurrences of `x` in the array, but it only removes the first one. In this example, as in many cases, the randomly generated test case contains junk values that have nothing to do with the test failure itself. When QuickCheck finds a failing test case, it tries to simplify it by applying some **shrinking** strategies. In fact the failing case is much complex but the shrinking algorithm has simplified it to the minimal case and presented it to us.\n\n### Traits\n\nNow let's move to the core of QuickCheck. The `quickcheck` function has the following signature:\n\n```moonbit\nfn quick_check[P : Testable](P) -> Unit!Failure\n```\n\nIt takes a value of type that implemented `Testable` as argument and runs the test. This is an effectful function that may throw an failure to the MoonBit test driver when a test fails (Or give up). If success, it simply returns `Unit` with the sentence `Ok, passed!` printed to the console.\n\n```moonbit\ntype Arrow[A, P] (A) -> P\nimpl[P : Testable, A : Arbitrary + Shrink + Show] Testable for Arrow[A, P]\n```\n\nThe `Arrow` type (wrapped single-valued function) does implement the `Testable` trait, so we can pass the property function directly to `quick_check`. Note that the argument type should have implemented the `Arbitrary` , `Shrink` and `Show` traits. The `Show` is necessary for the `quick_check` function to print the **counterexample** when a test fails, without which the testing is considered useless. The other two traits play important roles in QuickCheck. Now we give some brief introduction to them.\n\n`Arbitrary` is a trait that generates random values of a type.  It has a method `arbitrary` that takes a size and a random number generator and  then returns a random value of the type.\n```moonbit\npub trait Arbitrary {\n  arbitrary(Int, RandomState) -> Self\n}\n```\n\n`Shrink` is a trait that shrinks a value to a simpler one. It has a method `shrink` that takes a value and returns a iter of simpler values (Lazy).\n```moonbit\npub trait Shrink {\n  shrink(Self) -> Iter[Self]\n}\n```\n\nNow we given to a more detailed explanation to the underlying structure of `Arbitrary` and its relation to the generators. \n\n### Generators\n\nTest data is produced by test data generators. QuickCheck defines default generators for some often used types, but you can use your own, and will need to define your own generators for any new types you introduce (Or for simple types we can use the trivial definition by `derive(Arbitrary)`).\n\nGenerators have types of the form `Gen[T]`, which is a generator for values of type `T`. It was defined as a struct, it contains single field named `gen`, with type `(Int, RandomState) -> T` (The first parameter is the size of the generated value, and the second is the random number generator), notice that this is similar to the `arbitrary` method in the `Arbitrary` trait:\n```moonbit\nstruct Gen[T] {\n  gen : (Int, RandomState) -> T\n}\n```\n\nQuickCheck defines a series of useful methods for `Gen[T]`, for the most basic ones, we can use `Gen::new(f: (Int, RandomState) -> T)` to create a generator from a function and run it by invoking the `run` method:\n```moonbit\nlet g : Gen[Int] = Gen::new(..) // Suppose we have a generator for Int\nlet x : Int = g.run(100, RandomState::new()) // Generate a random Int at size 100\n```\n\n`Gen[T]` was implemented as functor, applicative and monad which means you can compose it in many ways. \n```moonbit\nfn pure[T](val : T) -> Gen[T]\nfn fmap[T, U](self : Gen[T], f : (T) -> U) -> Gen[U]\nfn ap[T, U](self : Gen[(T) -> U], v : Gen[T]) -> Gen[U]\nfn bind[T, U](self : Gen[T], f : (T) -> Gen[U]) -> Gen[U]\n```\n\nFor instance, you can use the `fmap` method to transform the generated value:\n```moonbit\nlet g : Gen[Int] = Gen::new(..)\nlet g2 : Gen[Int] = g.fmap(fn(x) { x + 1 })\nlet g3 : Gen[String] = g.fmap(fn(x) { x.to_string() })\n```\n\nOr create a dependent generator:\n```moonbit\nlet g : Gen[Int] = Gen::new(..)\nlet g2 : Gen[Int] = g.bind(fn(x : Int) { \n  if x == 0 {\n    Gen::pure(100)\n  } else {\n    Gen::pure(200)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThe following documents explains some useful combinators for `Gen[T]`.\n\n#### Choosing between alternatives\n\nA generator may take the form `one_of` which chooses among the generators in the array with equal probability. For example, this generates a random boolean which is true with probability one half:\n\n```moonbit\nlet gen_bool : Gen[Bool] = one_of([pure(true), pure(false)])\n```\n\nIf you want to control the distribution of results using frequency instead. We have `frequency` which chooses a generator from the array randomly, but weighs the probability of choosing each alternative by the factor given. For example, this generates true in the probability of $4/5$.\n\n```moonbit\nlet gen_freq : Gen[Bool] = frequency([(4, pure(true)), (1, pure(false))])\n```\n\n#### Size parameter\n\nWe have pointed that test data generators have an size parameter. QuickCheck begins by generating small test cases, and gradually increases the size as testing progresses. Different test data generators interpret the size parameter in different ways: some _ignore_ it, some interprets it as an upper bound on the size of containers. Most generators defined in `Arbitrary` trait depends on the size parameter but most separated generator combinators does not. \n\nYou can obtain the value of the size parameter using `sized` combinator.\n```moonbit\npub fn sized[T](f : (Int) -> Gen[T]) -> Gen[T]\n```\n\nFor example, we can make a trivial generator for a list of integers with a given length:\n```moonbit\nlet gen : Gen[Int] = sized(fn { size => pure(size) })\nlet arr = Array::makei(20, fn { i => gen.sample(size=i) })\ninspect!(arr, content=\"[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\")\n```\n\nThe purpose of size control is to ensure that test cases are large enough to reveal errors, while remaining small enough to test fast. Sometimes the default size control does not achieve this. So we have provided some tool functions like `resize` and `scale` (check the document for details) for this purpose.\n\n#### Default Generators\n\nQuickCheck defines default test data generators and shrinkers for some often used types (By trait `Arbitrary` and `Shrink`). You do not need to define or apply these explicitly for every property because QuickCheck can provide a property with appropriate generators and shrinkers for the property's arguments. But if you are required to do so, you can use the `forall` for explicitly universal quantification. \n\n```moonbit\nquick_check!(forall(spawn(), fn(x : List[Int]) { x.rev().rev() == x }))\n```\n\nNote that the `spawn` function is useful for creating `Gen[T]` from its arbitrary instance, in this example the type checker infers the type of the first argument in `forall` to be `Gen[List[T]]` from the type of the property function.\n```moonbit\nfn Gen::spawn[T : Arbitrary]() -> Gen[T]\n```\n\n### Shrinkers\n\nShrinkers have types of the form `(T) -> Iter[T]`. When given a value, a shrinker produces a sequence of values that are (in some way) simpler than the given value. If QuickCheck finds a set of values that fails a given property, it will try to make that value simpler than the original value by getting the shrinks for the value and trying each one in turn to check that the property is still false. If it is, the smaller value becomes the new counterexample and the shrinking process continues with that value.\n\n## Advanced Topics\n\n### QuickCheck Invalid Case\n\nThis section summarizes some common mistakes in using QuickCheck:\n- Testing with external effects: If a property requires an external state, for example, the user's input, the global mutable and etc, you should pass the state as an argument to the property function. Otherwise, the property is not a pure function and the test is not repeatable.\n- Mutable arguments was unexpectedly modified: You should keep the arguments **immutable** in the property function. If you need to modify the arguments, you should make a copy of them.\n\n### Custom Generator\n\nRecall the `remove` function we want to test before. The QuickCheck do report an error for us, but the generator is quite random and the tuple element `(x, arr): (Int, Array[Int])` is independent. In most cases, the `x` is not in the array, so the test is not very meaningful (falls to the branch `None => ()`). Now we use the `one_of_array` combinator to generate a random element from a generated non-empty array, which makes the test more meaningful.\n\n```moonbit\ntest {\n  quick_check!(\n    forall(\n      spawn(),\n      fn(a : Array[Int]) {\n        forall(one_of_array(a), \n          fn(y : Int) { remove(a, y).contains(y).not() })\n        |> filter(a.length() != 0)\n      },\n    ),\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWe admit the following facts:\n- The first `spawn` evaluates to a generator of `Array[Int]`.\n- The `forall` function can be nested.\n- There is a `filter` function that filters out the test cases that do not satisfy the condition, non-empty array is required in this case.\n- The `one_of_array` function selects a random element from a non-empty array.\n\n```\n*** [4/33/100] Failed! Falsified.\n[0, 0]\n0\n```\n\nWe find that there are 33 cases that do not satisfy the condition, and the counterexample is `[0, 0]` and `0`, which points out the issue clearly. The `one_of_array` function selects a random element from the array, so the `y` is always `0` in this case. The `remove` function only removes the first one, so the property does not hold.\n\n### Conditional Properties\n\nNow let's further verify our hypothesis: The function `remove` only removes the first one but not all. So if we instead formulate a conditional property which restricts the input array contains no duplicated elements, then our tests should pass. Use the function `filter` can filter out unwanted test cases:\n\n```moonbit\ntest {\n  fn no_duplicate(x : Array[Int]) -> Bool {\n    @sorted_set.from_iter(x.iter()).size() == x.length().to_int64()\n  }\n\n  quick_check!(\n    forall(\n      spawn(),\n      fn(iarr : (Int, Array[Int])) {\n        let (x, arr) = iarr\n        filter(remove(arr.copy(), x).contains(x).not(), no_duplicate(arr))\n      },\n    ),\n  )\n}\n```\n\n- Notice that we use `arr.copy()` to make a copy of the array, because the `remove` function may modify the argument array.\n- The `no_duplicate` function checks whether the input array contains no duplicated elements.\n- As discussed above, the `filter` combinator filters out the test cases that do not satisfy the condition.\n\nRunning this test, we find that all tests passed. Now we have strong evidence that the `remove` function only removes the first one but not all.\n\n### Classifying Data\n\nWe may interest in the distribution of the generated data: sometimes the generator may produce trivial data that does not help us to find the bugs. We want to find out what data is generated and how often in order to improve the generator. QuickCheck provides functions like `label`, `collect` and `classify` to achieve this.\n\n```moonbit\ntest \"classes\" {\n  quick_check_fn!(\n    fn(x : List[Int]) {\n      Arrow(prop_rev)\n      |> classify(x.length() > 5, \"long list\")\n      |> classify(x.length() <= 5, \"short list\")\n    },\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe `classify` function takes a boolean and a string, and if the boolean is true, the test case is classified with the string.\n```\n+++ [100/0/100] Ok, passed!\n22% : short list\n78% : long list\n```\n\nThe `label` function takes a string and classifies the test case with the string.\n```moonbit\ntest \"label\" {\n  quick_check_fn!(\n    fn(x : List[Int]) {\n      Arrow(prop_rev)\n      |> label(if x.is_empty() { \"trivial\" } else { \"non-trivial\" })\n    }\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe result is as follows:\n```\n+++ [100/0/100] Ok, passed!\n8% : trivial\n92% : non-trivial\n```\n\nThe `collect` function is a generalization of `label`. The difference is that the `collect` takes an argument implementing the `Show` trait, and the `label` takes a string directly. The `collect` function is useful when you want to classify the test case with a complex value.\n\n## Application\nWe have applied MoonBit QuickCheck to test the correctness of the MoonBit core.
