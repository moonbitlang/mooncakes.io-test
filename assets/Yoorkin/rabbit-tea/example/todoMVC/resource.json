It doesn't mean the pattern is encouraged to be used in a small app like this.\n\n## Setup\n\nRun the following command to start the example:\n\n```bash\ncd src/example/todoMVC\nbash ./launch.sh\n``` \n\nThis command will build the project with js backend, and launch the server with node.\n\n\n\n",
