# mooncakes.io test assets

This repository contains the generated test assets for mooncakes.io. These assets are included as a submodule in the mooncakes.io repository. By using a submodule, we ensure that the test assets remain separate from the main codebase, reducing confusion and maintain a clean commit history.
